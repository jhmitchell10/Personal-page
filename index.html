            <p> <br>
                I was born and riased in the small town of Oak ridge, Tn. i grew up very interested in sports and began playing
            football and basketball at young age through the local Boy's Club. I attended elementary school at Willow Brook Elementary, and 
            when i was in first grade I tested into the gifted program in which I would remain through middle and highschool. I would go on
            to attend Robertsville Middle School, which was one of two middle schools in my hometown and then go on to attend Oak Ridge highschool,
            the sole highschool of the town. I made many friends and have a lot of fond memories of my hometown, but it was too small for me and i 
            always wanted to get away and see more of what the world had to offer.
                After highschool, i would go on to attend Middle Tennessee State University. I majored in marketing but at the time wasnt really sure 
            what i wanted to do with it. I spent one year there before i would go on to transfer to East Tennessee State University. I had a few really 
            good friends there and wanted to see what it was like. It was around that time i noticed i was getting burnt out on school and felt like i needed
            a break. I finished out my second year of college and to be honest wasn't looking forward to returning. It was then the biggest change of my life 
            took place.
                Just before school was to begin, my mom noticed my lack of entusiasm for returning to school for my third year. It was then she asked me if I wanted 
            to take a semester off and go visit my older cousin in San Francisco. I immediately jumped at the opportunity and at the beginning of September, I was on
            a one way flight to the bay area. I fell in love as soon as I landed and from that point on I never looked back. I would go on to live in the bay area
            for the next ten years before I decided that in order to live comfortably in an area that was so expensive, it would benefit me to futher my education. I 
            have quite a few friends with careers in the tech industry and decided i would to take the opportunity to learn more about it, this is the reason I ended up
            enrolling and the UC Berkeley web development cohort. I have never been afriad of a chanllenge and I look forward to what awaits me while I learn more about 
            coding and the life that await me once the cohort is finished.
